# Non-Windows The Guide library

This is a fork of the orignal Windows-only `libguide` and `gdeutil` source code, part of the awesome [The Guide](https://theguide.sourceforge.net/index.html) hierarchical note application, that works on non-Windows systems.

## ðŸ“˜ About The Guide

>The Guide is an application that allows you create documents ("guides") which inherently have a tree (which you can modify as you please) and text associated with each node of the tree. The text itself is of the rich-text variety, and the editor allows you to modify the style and formatting of the text (fonts, bold, italics etc).

>The Guide is a 32-bit native C++ Win32 application (that uses MFC). It will work on 64-bit platforms also.

The Guide stores notes in a `.gde` file, which is a binary file that contains a tree of nodes and their attributes (e.g. icon). Every node can have RTF formatted text (a note) as payload.

Development on the last released original The Guide version (2.0) seems to have stopped completely in 2008. Last [blog post](http://buildingtheguide.blogspot.com/) is from 2010. It looks like at the time, version 3.0 was in development:

>As we build the application on the Qt framework, we can install V3 no only on Windows, but Linux and Mac as well. The first two have our active attention, for Mac there is a vacancy.

But this cross platform version has never been released sadly.

## About this fork

This is a fork of `libguide` and `gdeutil` from the original 2.0 sources.

- `libguide` is the part of The Guide source code that contains the engine behind the main program. 
With the library you can load, manipulate and write The Guide V2 files.
- `gdeutil` is a command line utility that can convert `gde` files to XML.

While written in C, the orignal `libguide` and `gdeutil` use several Windows specific APIs, and therefore **do not** compile on non-Windows systems.

The code in this fork is modified so that is **does** work on at least macOS (tested) and possibly other Posix compatible systems (not tested).

Most notable changes from the original source:

- Use `mmap` instead of `CreateFileMapping`/`MapViewOfFile` for memory mapped files.
- Use Posix unicode functions like `mbsrtowcs`, instead of Windows specific ones, like `MultiByteToWideChar`.
- Removed `wintree.c`, `wintree.h`. These are specific for Windows TreeView components, and hence not usable on non-Windows systems.
- Use Makefile instead of Visual Studio project.
- Applied fixes to read `.gde` files on different architecture than it was created.
- Removed support for v1 gde files; this fork only supports v2.

## Building

    $ make

Debug build:

    $  make DEBUG=1
    
### Dependencies

There are no dependencies, other than the C standard library.

## Using

The original library is not documented, but the code is pretty readable.
With the help of the header files you should be able to use library fairy quickly

There is also a `test` directory, with some example code.

## Extras

### kaitai Struct format description

In `extra/kaitai` you'll find [Kaitai](https://kaitai.io/) format description file for the 32bit and 64bit versions
of Gde files.

kaitai Struct is a really cool project (go check it out!) to generate parsers for binary formats:

>The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai Struct language (.ksy file) and then can be compiled with ksc into source files in one of the supported programming languages. These modules will include a generated code for a parser that can read the described data structure from a file or stream and give access to it in a nice, easy-to-comprehend API.

So, with the provided `.kty` files (in YAML format), you can generate The Guide parsers for several languages, such as Go, Java, Python, etc.

You can aslo use Kaitai Struct to create a JSON or XML export:

```bash
$ gem install kaitai-struct-visualizer
# JSON output
$ ksdump -f json guide.gde gde32.kty
# XML output
$ ksdump -f xml guide.gde gde32.kty
```

For convenience, `.kty` files are provided for both 32bit and 64bit `libguide` versions. In practice most files a probably created with the 32bit version, so you would not need the latter.

## Known issues/todo

In general: this library is not well tested. 

It has been mainly tried out with some old `.gde` files I still had. Your mileage may vary with other files.

Specific issues worth mentioning:

- Unfortunately in the original code, `gde` output is architecture specific. That means a 32 bit version would
create different files than a 64 bit version of The Guide. That is because the byte size of certain values (node id's) written/read from disk, depend on the pointer size the machine it is running on. However, as far as I know, only 32bit version of The Guide 2.0 exist. Therefore this fork, also when running on a 64 bit machine, always asumes 32bit The Guide files.
    - [] TODO: Check several scenarios of reading/writing on multiple architectures.
- Currently, `gdeutil` is hardcoded to work only with 32-bit `gde` files. 
    - [] TODO: add switch to make this dynamic.
- Unicode handling (`convert_to_utf8`, `convert_to_unicode_from_usercp`) not well tested, and probably does not handle all use cases wel.

## Fine print

This code is provided "as is" without warranty or support of any kind.
Use this library as reference, to play around with, etc., but not for anything serious.

It may eat your laundry (notes). It shouldn't, but it might.[Â¹](https://github.com/blofroth/taskigt)

## QA

Q: Why did you make this? It's totally unnecessary.

A: I felt nostalgic when I encoutered my old The Guide files.

Q: Does it work?

A: Kind of. Seems to work for my use cases. Feel free to fork and improve.
